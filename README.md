# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description 

I created an application from base code that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include: uppercase letters, lower case letters, numbers, and/or special characters [list of password special characters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```
